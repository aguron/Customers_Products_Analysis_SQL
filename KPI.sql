 * 1. Which products should we order more of or less of?
 *
 *
 * Two important KPIs for addressing this question are the:
 *
 *  Stock to Sales Ratio = quantityInStock / SUM(quantityOrdered)
 *
 *  Product Performance = SUM(quantityOrdered Ã— priceEach)
 *
 *
 * A relatively low Stock to Sales Ratio is indicative of a
 * product that is closer to being out-of-stock. The Product
 * Performance corresponds to the total sales for a product.
 * Products that should be prioritized are those with high
 * product performance that are on the brink of being out of
 * stock.
 *
 * The products and orderdetails tables are used to compute the
 * Stock to Sales Ratio and Product Performance KPIs.

/*
 * Conclusion
 *
 * 1. Which products should we order more of or less of?
 *
 * The majority of the 10 highest priority products for
 * restocking are Motorcycles and Vintage Cars (please see
 * csv/priority_products.csv). One may want to investigate
 * further if a broader focus on Motorcyles and Vintage Cars is
 * appropriate.
 *
 * 2. How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies
 *    to customer behaviors?
 *
 * Information on the top 5 VIP customers and the 5 least engaged
 * customers can be found in csv/top_5_vip_customers.csv and
 * csv/5_least_engaged_customers.csv respectively. With this
 * knowledge, one can reach out these customer segments
 * accordingly.
 *
 * 3. How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?
 *
 * The customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is approximately 39,000 USD
 * (please see csv/customer_ltv.csv). This suggests that if there
 * are 10 new customers next month, there will be approximately
 * 390,000 more in lifetime profits. Some percentage of these
 * anticipated additional profits would have to be put towards
 * attracting the new customers.
